/**
 * Ephemeral test database matching production client semantics: the runtime
 * hands isolated plugins an async libsql-backed Drizzle client, so tests use
 * the same driver — notably its `transaction()` behavior, which the sync
 * better-sqlite3 driver does not share. Applies the real generated
 * migrations (journal and all), exactly the path the platform runs at
 * startup.
 *
 * A temp *file* rather than `:memory:`, deliberately: @libsql/client's
 * sqlite3 flavour opens a fresh connection for each interactive
 * `transaction()`, and every `:memory:` connection is its own brand-new
 * empty database — verified empirically here: after `db.transaction()` on a
 * `:memory:` client, previously-migrated tables are simply gone. A file URL
 * gives all connections the same database.
